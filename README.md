# The WormObserver
# A lightweight solution for adding a Raspberry Pi Camera to a stereoscopic microscope
*(e.g. to track worms on a agar plate)*

## General

This is an adapted version of an adapter allowing coupling of a standard Raspberry Pi camera to a **model** Zeiss microscope.
The Raspberry Pi camera can be either glued directly to the printed holder or fixed with screws through the dedicated holes on the camera chip.

## Attaching the camera to the Raspberry Pi

To allow convenient allignment of the camera with respect to the focal plane of the objective, it is recommended to use [the longer connection cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1731) when connecting the camera to the Raspberry Pi. 

## Alligning the camera

It is recommended to allign the camera via the live preview mode directly within the Raspberry Pi GUI. To allow a maximum of flexibility, the Rasperry Pi can be directly coupled to a 7'' Touchscreen Display and a keyboard. To protect the display from the potential hazardous environment of a typical benchspace a custom [3D-printable case is available on thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1585924).
